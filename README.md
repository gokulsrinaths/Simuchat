## Abstract

SimuChat is a novel multi-agent conversational AI system that simulates complex social dynamics through emotional intelligence, trust modeling, and personality-driven interactions. The system creates a miniature AI society where agents exhibit realistic emotional responses, form trust relationships, and engage in meaningful dialogue that evolves over time.

## Motivation

Traditional chatbot systems lack the capacity to simulate multi-agent interactions, especially when emotional state, memory, and inter-agent relationships like trust are essential to meaningful dialogue. SimuChat addresses this gap by modeling a miniature AI society in the terminal, simulating complex interpersonal dynamics between autonomous agents through personality-driven dialogue.

## System Overview

SimuChat is a command-line simulation of a WhatsApp-style group chat, where:

- **Agents possess distinct personalities** (kind, logical, bold) with unique emotional profiles
- **Each message interaction triggers changes** in trust, emotion, and memory through mathematical models
- **An LLM (Meta LLaMA-4-Maverick-17B)** generates context-rich, personalized responses
- **Emotional contagion** spreads between agents based on trust relationships and personality compatibility
- **Trust dynamics** evolve through interaction patterns, emotional alignment, and behavioral consistency

### Mathematical Framework

The system employs several mathematical models to simulate realistic social dynamics:

#### 1. Emotional Contagion Model

The emotional contagion effect is calculated using a weighted influence model:

```
Contagion Effect = Σ(Emotion_Intensity × Influence_Weight × Base_Rate × (1 - Resistance))
```

Where:
- **Influence_Weight** = Trust_Score × Trust_Weight + Proximity_Score × Proximity_Weight
- **Resistance** = (1 - Empathy) × Personality_Weight + Stability × (1 - Personality_Weight)
- **Base_Rate** = 0.3 (default contagion rate)
- **Trust_Weight** = 0.4, **Proximity_Weight** = 0.3, **Personality_Weight** = 0.3

#### 2. Trust Update Model

Trust changes are computed through a multi-factor analysis:

```
Trust_Delta = Emotional_Alignment × 0.1 + Personality_Compatibility × 0.1 + 
              Content_Sentiment × 0.05 + Emotional_State_Impact × 0.05
```

Where:
- **Emotional_Alignment** = (Same_Bias ? 0.4 : 0) + (1 - Intensity_Diff) × 0.3 + Shared_Emotions_Ratio × 0.3
- **Personality_Compatibility** = Trait_Similarity_Score
- **Content_Sentiment** = (Positive_Words - Negative_Words) × 0.05

#### 3. Emotional State Evolution

Emotions decay over time following an exponential decay model:

```
Emotion_Intensity(t) = Emotion_Intensity(t-1) × exp(-Decay_Rate × Time_Delta)
```

Where **Decay_Rate** = 0.1 per conversation turn.

#### 4. Personality-Based Initial States

Initial emotional states are set based on personality traits:

```
Initial_Emotion = Base_Personality_Trait × Personality_Weight + 
                  Random_Component × (1 - Personality_Weight)
```

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Agent Emotional Intelligence
- **8-dimensional emotional space**: joy/sadness, trust/disgust, fear/anger, surprise/anticipation, optimism/pessimism, calmness/anxiety, interest/boredom, confidence/uncertainty
- **Emotional contagion** with personality-based resistance
- **Emotional triggers** based on message content and agent history
- **Mood persistence** with configurable duration

### 2. Dynamic Trust Modeling
- **Bidirectional trust relationships** between all agent pairs
- **Trust evolution** based on interaction quality, emotional alignment, and behavioral consistency
- **Trust visualization** with real-time updates
- **Trust-based influence** on emotional contagion

### 3. Personality-Driven Interactions
- **Distinct agent personalities**: Alice (kind/empathetic), Bob (logical/analytical), Charlie (bold/assertive)
- **Personality-consistent responses** generated by LLaMA-4-Maverick-17B
- **Personality-based emotional triggers** and resistance to contagion
- **Behavioral consistency tracking**

### 4. Real-Time Insights System
- **Conversation analysis** after each interaction round
- **Emotional state tracking** with change explanations
- **Trust relationship dynamics** visualization
- **Social interaction patterns** identification
- **Defensive behavior detection** and analysis

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Components
- **Python-based simulation engine** with modular design
- **Meta LLaMA-4-Maverick-17B API integration** for natural language generation
- **Emotional intelligence engine** with mathematical modeling
- **Trust engine** with relationship tracking
- **Memory system** for conversation history and emotional states

### Frontend Interface
- **Terminal-based chat interface** with real-time updates
- **Emotional state displays** with intensity indicators
- **Trust relationship visualization** using ASCII art
- **Insights panel** with detailed analysis
- **Interactive command system** for user engagement

### Data Management
- **JSON-based configuration** for agent personalities and system settings
- **Persistent storage** for conversation history and emotional states
- **Real-time metrics tracking** for analysis and debugging
- **Export capabilities** for research and analysis

### Key Features Demonstrated

1. Personality-Driven Responses: Each agent maintains their unique personality throughout the conversation
2. Emotional State Tracking: Real-time emotional states are displayed with each message
3. Trust Evolution: Trust relationships change based on interaction quality and content
4. Insights Generation: The system provides detailed analysis of conversation dynamics
5. Memory Integration: Agents reference previous interactions and maintain context

### Emotional Contagion Example
```
Alice: "I'm so excited about our new project!"
[Charlie's joy increases from 0.3 to 0.5 due to emotional contagion from Alice]
Charlie: "Your enthusiasm is contagious! I'm feeling more optimistic too."
```

### Trust Evolution Example
```
Bob: "I agree with Alice's analysis. Her approach is well-reasoned."
[Bob's trust in Alice increases from 0.6 to 0.68 due to agreement and positive sentiment]
```
