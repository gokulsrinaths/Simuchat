# SimuChat - AI Group Chat with Memory and Trust

SimuChat is a WhatsApp-style group chat simulator that creates conversations between three AI agents (Alice, Bob, and Charlie), each with distinct personalities. The agents maintain memory of past conversations, develop trust relationships with each other, and can have "insight moments" during the discussion.

## Features

- **3 Unique AI Personas**: Alice (empathetic), Bob (logical), and Charlie (competitive)
- **Agent Memory**: Each agent remembers previous messages and builds context
- **Insight Detection**: Identifies when agents change their mind or have realizations
- **Trust Engine**: Trust scores evolve between agents based on agreement/disagreement
- **Emotion + Mood Simulation**: Dynamic emotions and moods affect agent responses
- **Configurable Agent Setup**: Easy to add or modify agents
- **Logging**: Detailed conversation logs in JSONL and HTML formats
- **Console and Streamlit UI**: Both terminal and web interfaces available

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Your Meta LLaMA API key should be set in the `env.py` file:

```python
API_KEY = "YOUR_META_API_KEY"  # Format: "LLM|1050039463644017|ZZzxjun1klZ76kW0xu5Zg4BW5-o"
```

## Running SimuChat

### Atropos / Headless Mode

SimuChat can be run programmatically or as part of an automated system:

```python
from environments.hack0.simuchat.env import run

# Run simulation for 5 turns with prompt
metrics = run(
    prompt="Discuss the impact of AI on society", 
    num_turns=5, 
    headless=True
)
```

This will generate:
- `output/chatlog.jsonl` - Full conversation log
- `output/chatlog.html` - HTML formatted log
- `output/metrics.jsonl` - Metrics for WandB compatibility

### Terminal Interface

Run the console application:

```
python main.py
```

### Streamlit UI (Optional)

Run the Streamlit web interface:

```
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## How It Works

1. The user types a starting topic (e.g., "Let's discuss climate change")
2. Alice, Bob, and Charlie respond in sequence, using their unique personalities
3. Each agent maintains memory of previous messages
4. Trust scores between agents evolve based on agreement/disagreement
5. The system tracks "insight moments" when agents change perspective
6. A log of the conversation is saved in both JSONL and HTML formats

## Metrics and Analysis

SimuChat tracks several metrics during the conversation that can be used for analysis:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `num_messages` | Total number of messages exchanged |
| `agent_messages` | Number of messages from each agent |
| `insights` | Count of insight moments per agent |
| `emotions` | Distribution of emotions expressed by each agent |
| `moods` | Distribution of moods experienced by each agent |
| `trust_scores` | Trust relationships between every agent pair |
| `avg_trust` | Average trust score for each agent |
| `duration` | Total running time of the simulation |

These metrics are saved in `metrics.jsonl` and can be loaded directly into WandB for visualization.

## Adding More Agents

1. Open `agents_config.json`
2. Add a new agent definition:

```json
{
  "name": "Diana",
  "emoji": "ðŸŒŸ",
  "system_prompt": "You are Diana, a visionary and creative AI...",
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "core_emotion": "inspired",
  "mood": "excited",
  "memory_limit": 3,
  "initial_trust": 0.5
}
```

## Technical Details

- **API**: Uses Meta's LLaMA API (model: `Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8`)
- **Memory**: Each agent maintains memory of the last 3 messages from other agents
- **Trust**: Trust scores range from 0.0 to 1.0, starting at 0.5
- **Insight Detection**: Uses pattern matching and agreement/disagreement analysis
- **Logging**: Detailed logs are saved for later analysis
